# in-scribe
Simple, in-page content editing.

## Installation

1. Copy the "in-scribe" folder to your website's base directory.
2. Include the in-scribe PHP module at the top of each webpage you want to have editable content.
3. Include the in-scribe JavaScript app in the head or body of the webpage.
4. Move editable content sections to their own HTML files. (If you don't have content yet, that's okay, just skip this step.)
5. Include the content loaders in the original file. (If you don't have content yet, these will mark where content can be added in the page.)
